So about 3.6% of the Nobel prizes in science since 2000 have been won by Harvard faculty and alumni. Very good, but also not anything terribly staggering.</p><p>There have been a total of 35 economics prizes since 2000. The faculty and alumni of Harvard, just one university, has won 14.3% of them. And it looks like everyone who has won the economics prize since 2000 has been student and professor at a US or UK institution. I don't take the economics prize seriously to be honest, and neither do many people. A guy I talk to quit Harvard economics PhD to do startup in China. He says nothing really valuable has come out of the field the past 20 years. I won't go into what I feel is wrong about economics as a field, as well as the establishing and awarding of certain prestige prizes to people for work that does not necessarily reflect reality but promotes certain policies on behalf of certain powerful interest groups.</p><p>The literature and peace prizes are even more problematic. As for the peace prize, three US presidents (we can crudely count Al Gore here) have won it since 2000 while at the same time, it has been awarded to two pro-West Soviet dissident and a Chinese dissident. I have to discredit it here since that Harvard link had Al Gore in it.</p><p>As for Connes, the Fields Medal statistics are 13, France 11, Soviet Union 9, Britain 6, Japan 3, Germany 1. (See <a href=\"https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgmachine1729.com%2Fwritings-by-category%2Ftranslations%2Fis-americas-education-and-science-research-system-really-the-best-in-the-world%2F.%29%3A0_6nizLAq6yondE7LgSl3r6KC0E&amp;cuid=320226\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://gmachine1729.com/writings-by-category/translations/is-americas-education-and-science-research-system-really-the-best-in-the-world/.)\">https://gmachine1729.com/wr...</a></p><p>Not to mention even with the Fields Medal, there are guys like Gelfand, Arnold, Kashiwara, Shimura who seem to be regarded by those qualified to judge as more significant mathematicians than most of the Fields Medal winners, especially the US ones, who never won the prize.</p><p>My experience has been that the Anglo world is biased to the absurd politically, and that extends a bit to science prizes as well, which should ideally have a zero where you're from and what your politics are component. The Anglo world has been dominant for the past couple centuries, and the world is rather used to it. It peaked at the end of WWII with US much strengthened and the rest of the advanced countries in ruins. Since then, the rest of the world has been rapidly catching up.</p><p>I think the best way to deal with this is gradually ignore and detach as US international influence diminishes. Not all that much point arguing against Anglo bias in the Anglo language with mostly self-interested Anglos either, it's about as futile as an East Asian struggling to rise to the top in America. As for English as the international language, people from non English countries can and probably will use it basically only when necessary, functioning almost exclusively in their own language. Let the Anglo world do and believe their own thing. They may feel they are the best and that the world centers around them, but the world is, really, ever more ignoring it. Even US graduate school now, there are relatively few people coming from continental Europe.

Michael Spence, Ph.D. \u201972\nEconomics, 2001\n\nThere have been 11 since 2000. 5 of those 11 were in science, and as for the rest, 5 in economics, 1 in peace (Al Gore climate change lol).\n\nSince 2000, there have been 48 physics prizes, 46 chemistry prizes, 45 in biology prizes, a total of 138. So about 3.6% of the Nobel prizes in science since 2000 have been won by Harvard faculty and alumni. Very good, but also not anything terribly staggering.\n\nThere have been a total of 35 economics prizes since 2000. The faculty and alumni of Harvard, just one university, has won 14.3% of them. And it looks like everyone who has won the economics prize since 2000 has been student and professor at a US or UK institution. I don't take the economics prize seriously to be honest, and neither do many people. A guy I talk to quit Harvard economics PhD to do startup in China. He says nothing really valuable has come out of the field the past 20 years. I won't go into what I feel is wrong about economics as a field, as well as the establishing and awarding of certain prestige prizes to people for work that does not necessarily reflect reality but promotes certain policies on behalf of certain powerful interest groups.\n\nThe literature and peace prizes are even more problematic. As for the peace prize, three US presidents (we can crudely count Al Gore here) have won it since 2000 while at the same time, it has been awarded to two pro-West Soviet dissident and a Chinese dissident. I have to discredit it here since that Harvard link had Al Gore in it.\n\nAs for Connes, the Fields Medal statistics are 13, France 11, Soviet Union 9, Britain 6, Japan 3, Germany 1. (See https://gmachine1729.com/writings-by-category/translations/is-americas-education-and-science-research-system-really-the-best-in-the-world/.)\n\nNot to mention even with the Fields Medal, there are guys like Gelfand, Arnold, Kashiwara, Shimura who seem to be regarded by those qualified to judge as more significant mathematicians than most of the Fields Medal winners, especially the US ones, who never won the prize.\n\nMy experience has been that the Anglo world is biased to the absurd politically, and that extends a bit to science prizes as well, which should ideally have a zero where you're from and what your politics are component. The Anglo world has been dominant for the past couple centuries, and the world is rather used to it. It peaked at the end of WWII with US much strengthened and the rest of the advanced countries in ruins. Since then, the rest of the world has been rapidly catching up.\n\nI think the best way to deal with this is gradually ignore and detach as US international influence diminishes. Not all that much point arguing against Anglo bias in the Anglo language with mostly self-interested Anglos either, it's about as futile as an East Asian struggling to rise to the top in America. As for English as the international language, people from non English countries can and probably will use it basically only when necessary, functioning almost exclusively in their own language. Let the Anglo world do and believe their own thing. They may feel they are the best and that the world centers around them, but the world is, really, ever more ignoring it. Even US graduate school now, there are relatively few people coming from continental Europe. It's mostly people from Asian countries excluding Japan, and to a lesser extent East Europeans, with Chinese increasingly opting not to come here, especially permanently.","parent_post":"forums.Post?id=4110758122","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6926282944","forum":"infoproc","url":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-french-way-alain-connes-interview.html#comment-4110881637","points":0,"moderationLabels":["links"],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"forums.Post?id=4368929559":{"editableUntil":"2019-03-14T23:08:40","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"<p>Sorry if that was unclear.

Our leaders, actually dominators, are a threat to our lives and the lives of our children.\n\nIf you do not have an AR 15, you are a fool.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6658641810","forum":"pj-instapundit","points":-1,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"forums.Thread?id=6907244459":{"feed":"https://infoproc.disqus.com/information_processing_jordan_peterson_identity_politics_iq_harvard_and_asian_admissions/latest.rss","author":"auth.User?id=2397814","topics":[],"dislikes":0,"likes":0,"message":"","isSpam":false,"isDeleted":false,"category":"328489","clean_title":"Jordan Peterson: Identity Politics, IQ, Harvard and Asian admissions","userScore":0,"id":"6907244459","signedLink":"http://disq.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Finfoproc.blogspot.com%2F2018%2F09%2Fjordan-peterson-identity-politics-iq.html&key=LJ4hcyJvlRJp3tiN70-JHA","createdAt":"2018-09-12T12:18:50","hasStreaming":false,"raw_message":"","isClosed":false,"link":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/09/jordan-peterson-identity-politics-iq.html","slug":"information_processing_jordan_peterson_identity_politics_iq_harvard_and_asian_admissions","forum":"forums.Forum?id=320226","identifiers":[],"posts":17,"userSubscription":false,"validateAllPosts":false,"title":"Information Processing: Jordan Peterson: Identity Politics, IQ, Harvard and Asian admissions","highlightedPost":null},"forums.Post?id=4415798539":{"editableUntil":"2019-04-16T14:25:28","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>\u6ca1\u9519\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u4fb5\u534e\u53ea\u4e0d\u8fc7\u662f\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u662f\u82f1\u6587\u754c\uff0c\u65b0\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ece\u67d0\u79cd\u89d2\u5ea6\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u5f53\u5e74\u7684\u65e5\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6210\u529f\u4e86\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5b66\u7f8e\u56fd\u878d\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd\u50bb\u903c\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\u662f\u9ec4\u79cd\u4eba\uff0c\u5112\u5bb6\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6bd4\u6211\u4eec\u65e9\uff0c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u4eba\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\u6709\u7ea2\u8272\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u554a\uff0c\u5c31\u5475\u5475\u4e86\u3002</p>","id":"4415798539","createdAt":"2019-04-09T14:25:28","author":{"username":"gmachine1729","about":"","name":"gmachine1729","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2017-12-06T04:04:24","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/gmachine1729/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"273263163","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isHighlighted":false,"parent":4415555991,"isApproved":true,"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"\u6ca1\u9519\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u4fb5\u534e\u53ea\u4e0d\u8fc7\u662f\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u662f\u82f1\u6587\u754c\uff0c\u65b0\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ece\u67d0\u79cd\u89d2\u5ea6\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u5f53\u5e74\u7684\u65e5\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6210\u529f\u4e86\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u5b66\u7f8e\u56fd\u878d\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd\u50bb\u903c\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\u662f\u9ec4\u79cd\u4eba\uff0c\u5112\u5bb6\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6bd4\u6211\u4eec\u65e9\uff0c\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u4eba\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\u6709\u7ea2\u8272\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u554a\uff0c\u5c31\u5475\u5475\u4e86\u3002","parent_post":"forums.Post?id=4415555991","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=7345898895","forum":"gmachine1729","url":"https://gmachine1729.com/2019/04/09/different-types-of-people/#comment-4415798539","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"forums.Post?id=4114110975":{"editableUntil":"2018-10-02T21:17:10","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>Also interesting to note is that I became more aware recently of how a minority of the top Chinese math students did study abroad in France as opposed to US and those people tended to do better.

I was surprised by how on the Chinese internet, when some naturalized Chinese immigrant very successful in an American institution is mentioned, there are people who go, \"American, nothing to do with us.\"","parent_post":"forums.Post?id=4114991407","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6926282944","forum":"infoproc","url":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-french-way-alain-connes-interview.html#comment-4119679797","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":true,"sb":false},"forums.Thread?id=6731516340":{"feed":"https://pj-instapundit.disqus.com/cold_war_ii_brit_arrested_over_suspected_chinese_plot_to_steal_secrets_of_100million_raf_stealth/latest.rss","author":"auth.User?id=182842843","topics":[],"dislikes":0,"likes":0,"message":"","isSpam":false,"isDeleted":false,"category":"4812097","clean_title":"COLD WAR II: Brit arrested over suspected Chinese plot to steal secrets of \u00a3100million RAF stealth \u2026","userScore":0,"id":"6731516340","signedLink":"https://disq.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpjmedia.com%2Finstapundit%2F299366%2F&key=1u7-kqQuhoMeDTuB6rvZCw","createdAt":"2018-06-14T14:10:17","hasStreaming":false,"raw_message":"","isClosed":false,"link":"https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/299366/","slug":"cold_war_ii_brit_arrested_over_suspected_chinese_plot_to_steal_secrets_of_100million_raf_stealth","forum":"forums.Forum?id=4235850","identifiers":["1-299366"],"posts":25,"userSubscription":false,"validateAllPosts":false,"title":"COLD WAR II: Brit arrested over suspected Chinese plot to steal secrets of \u00a3100million RAF stealth \u2026","highlightedPost":null},"forums.Thread?id=6862189229":{"feed":"https://pj-instapundit.disqus.com/the_science_is_settled_engineers_refute_allegations_of_gender_bias_in_licensing_exam_a_recent_a/latest.rss","author":"auth.User?id=182842843","topics":[],"dislikes":0,"likes":0,"message":"","isSpam":false,"isDeleted":false,"category":"4812097","clean_title":"THE SCIENCE IS SETTLED:  Engineers refute allegations of gender bias in licensing exam.  \u201cA recent a\u2026","userScore":0,"id":"6862189229","signedLink":"https://disq.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpjmedia.com%2Finstapundit%2F305194%2F&key=JJKvZQEHyLTOEyD1A0I3yw","createdAt":"2018-08-19T14:04:04","hasStreaming":false,"raw_message":"","isClosed":false,"link":"https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/305194/","slug":"the_science_is_settled_engineers_refute_allegations_of_gender_bias_in_licensing_exam_a_recent_a","forum":"forums.Forum?id=4235850","identifiers":["1-305194"],"posts":212,"userSubscription":false,"validateAllPosts":false,"title":"THE SCIENCE IS SETTLED:  Engineers refute allegations of gender bias in licensing exam.  \u201cA recent a\u2026","highlightedPost":null},"forums.Post?id=4426188873":{"editableUntil":"2019-04-24T05:58:12","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<p>With your STEM and math background, you might be interested in the work of Miles Mathis.

I think this is a much more realistic scenario than Harvard yielding to any form of backlash against it.","parent_post":"forums.Post?id=3971157432","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6744852868","forum":"infoproc","url":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/06/harvard-office-of-institutional_21.html#comment-3971366090","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"forums.Post?id=4092396800":{"editableUntil":"2018-09-20T00:07:31","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":3,"message":"<p>Where is that room, Steve?</p>","id":"4092396800","createdAt":"2018-09-13T00:07:31","author":{"username":"gmachine1729","about":"","name":"gmachine1729","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2017-12-06T04:04:24","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/gmachine1729/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"273263163","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isHighlighted":false,"parent":null,"isApproved":true,"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"Where is that room, Steve?","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6907244459","forum":"infoproc","url":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/09/jordan-peterson-identity-politics-iq.html#comment-4092396800","points":3,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"forums.Post?id=4426085266":{"editableUntil":"2019-04-24T03:04:37","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"<blockquote>Most White Nationalists already know about the Jews but very few Chinese Nationalists do.</blockquote><p><br>Yes, but much has changed there over the past decade.

Lenovo the PC maker is basically a PC assembly shop based off Intel and Windows that moved its headquarters to USA after the IBM Thinkpad purchase, nothing to write home about. Its founder is now widely despised in China. On the other hand, Huawei has developed some serious technology, and its founder never had any experience abroad. His company doesn't IPO and he doesn't ever go to America to status whore with Silicon Valley billionaires the way Jack Ma does. I've even heard from government people in China that Jack Ma is going to end up in jail eventually, which I found hard to believe.\n\nPlenty within the former rich and educated in China supported the Chinese communists, and they were naturally integrated into the new system with high positions. They gave up some of their wealth for the greater good and after that they were still much better off than the average Chinese. Unfortunately, there was also a group of \u4e70\u529e\u4ea1\u56fd\u5974 who thought it was a better idea to continue to act as puppets for a nation and race that treats them like dogs and only rewards them to the extent that they are useful while entertaining delusions of superiority.

In contrast, another friend, a Chinese-Canadian, who I think is even smarter and won international olympiad medals too, among many other honors signaling very high g, who didn't not fare all that well in college applications, keeps bitching about what he perceives as the dearth of East Asians at the top of math and theoretical physics. I once asked him if he feels maybe Jews ever feel insecure with respect to East Asians, and he was like: no, they know they're smarter than us.</p><p>I'm actually quite impressed with how that guy could think so boldly out of the conventional wisdom, and I increasingly realize how what he's saying isn't unfounded. Steve is a theoretical physicist. He's written on here about a Feynman-Schwinger dichotomy in terms of cognitive profile and its concomitant intellectual style of doing physics. But I don't ever recall his mentioning that Tomonaga, who shared Nobel in 1965 with Feynman and Schwinger, did his seminal work in 1948 in the rubbles of Tokyo (!!!). Similarly, among other Japanese theorists, roughly equivalent to Tomonaga in stature, there were Yang and Lee who shocked the physics community by overturning law of conservation of parity, in the weak interaction case, which had never been seriously questioned, for which they won Nobel in 1957. There is also Yang-Mills theory, regarded by many as the most important development in theoretical physics in the latter half of the 20th century. While reading this, keep in mind that East Asians entered modern science quite late, from a very different culture an ocean apart, whereas Jews have been in Europe since well before modern science was born there.</p><p>By the way, I don't actually know physics well (though I did solve some problems in Griffiths E&amp;M on my own), but that doesn't mean I can't read about physics history.

In contrast, another friend, a Chinese-Canadian, who I think is even smarter and won international olympiad medals too, among many other honors signaling very high g, who didn't not fare all that well in college applications, keeps bitching about what he perceives as the dearth of East Asians at the top of math and theoretical physics. I once asked him if he feels maybe Jews ever feel insecure with respect to East Asians, and he was like: no, they know they're smarter than us.\n\nI'm actually quite impressed with how that guy could think so boldly out of the conventional wisdom, and I increasingly realize how what he's saying isn't unfounded. Steve is a theoretical physicist. He's written on here about a Feynman-Schwinger dichotomy in terms of cognitive profile and its concomitant intellectual style of doing physics. But I don't ever recall his mentioning that Tomonaga, who shared Nobel in 1965 with Feynman and Schwinger, did his seminal work in 1948 in the rubbles of Tokyo (!!!). Similarly, among other Japanese theorists, roughly equivalent to Tomonaga in stature, there were Yang and Lee who shocked the physics community by overturning law of conservation of parity, in the weak interaction case, which had never been seriously questioned, for which they won Nobel in 1957. There is also Yang-Mills theory, regarded by many as the most important development in theoretical physics in the latter half of the 20th century. While reading this, keep in mind that East Asians entered modern science quite late, from a very different culture an ocean apart, whereas Jews have been in Europe since well before modern science was born there.\n\nBy the way, I don't actually know physics well (though I did solve some problems in Griffiths E&M on my own), but that doesn't mean I can't read about physics history. Also, I do know quite a bit of graduate level pure math and have won modest awards in math and programming contests, so I'm clearly very high g, though most likely not a genius, IQ-wise, and if I really wanted to, I could learn quantum mechanics, general relativity, etc deeply.

Again, the people who were actually attacked during the Cultural Revolution were pretty much all relatively high up, party officials or those with at least college education, not a high base population to begin with.","parent_post":"forums.Post?id=3971446675","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6744852868","forum":"infoproc","url":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/06/harvard-office-of-institutional_21.html#comment-3971457675","points":0,"moderationLabels":["links"],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"forums.Thread?id=6775155465":{"feed":"https://infoproc.disqus.com/information_processing_cognitive_ability_predicted_from_fmri_caltech_neuroscience/latest.rss","author":"auth.User?id=2397814","topics":[],"dislikes":0,"likes":0,"message":"","isSpam":false,"isDeleted":false,"category":"328489","clean_title":"Cognitive ability predicted from fMRI (Caltech Neuroscience)","userScore":0,"id":"6775155465","signedLink":"http://disq.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Finfoproc.blogspot.com%2F2018%2F07%2Fcognitive-ability-predicted-from-fmri.html&key=qXuaX24CzPsOuevnwKwtHg","createdAt":"2018-07-05T19:26:04","hasStreaming":false,"raw_message":"","isClosed":false,"link":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/07/cognitive-ability-predicted-from-fmri.html","slug":"information_processing_cognitive_ability_predicted_from_fmri_caltech_neuroscience","forum":"forums.Forum?id=320226","identifiers":[],"posts":13,"userSubscription":false,"validateAllPosts":false,"title":"Information Processing: Cognitive ability predicted from fMRI (Caltech Neuroscience)","highlightedPost":null},"auth.User?id=1162871":{"username":"lubomotl","about":"Freelance string theorist","name":"Lubo\u0161 Motl","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2009-11-11T17:50:42","rep":12.257964000000001,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/lubomotl/","url":"http://motls.blogspot.com/","reputation":12.257964000000001,"location":"Pilsen, Czech Republic","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"http://disq.us/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmotls.blogspot.com%2F&key=HuM_tLincUr6vYL5Yh8_Ww","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"1162871","reputationLabel":"High","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lubomotl.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/116/2871/avatar32.jpg?1511853478"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lubomotl.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/116/2871/avatar92.jpg?1511853478","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/lubomotl.jpg","cache":"https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/116/2871/avatar92.jpg?1511853478"}}},"forums.Post?id=4227970248":{"editableUntil":"2018-12-13T14:38:37","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":4,"message":"<p>Seeing this, I'll say that today a theoretical physics professor I know WeChatted me with a link on the passing away of Shoucheng Zhang, Stanford condensed matter theorist, at the age 55.

Film is inherently cultural and political, and in that regard Chinese do just fine keeping to themselves. China can appropriate whatever techniques and such from the West but at the core keep its own culture. Just like how modern science is also part of Western culture, but China (and Japan too) over time introduced and \"localized\" it for its own survival and competitiveness, while still keeping its own cultural and national pride. There is a league of difference between learning from others to improve oneself and learning from others in acceptance of foreign influence or rule. This is I believe the essential difference between the Chinese left and the Chinese right, between the Chinese communists and KMT after their split.</p><p>Speaking of which, I learned from a Zhihu comment of a Chinese TV series on the civil war starting from 1927, and I was thoroughly impressed by the artistic quality of its music.

Another one of China's insecurities lol. Also another common way for many in the West to regard China as still inferior, as a system that stifles innovation blah blah blah. I think that's way overblown. Nobel Prize winners are usually 70+. It takes time and requires tradition that takes at least a generation or two to develop. Japan started much earlier and much more smoothly.</p><p>I remember when growing up, Japan was typically regarded as way superior to China. Much less so now but still in many ways Japan is far more developed, especially in basic science. What I would like to state here now is something almost never explicitly mentioned in the West that I hope more Chinese can be well aware of. It is that unlike Japan, which was fully occupied and ruled by the US Army after WWII and still has US soldiers and bases on its soil and quite an indirect degree of US influence over its politics, China is pretty much fully independent. On Zhihu, I was somewhat surprised when a guy commented that no, the Meiji Restoration was at the end not successful because Japan took its military expansion too far and eventually lost everything. China, while still much poorer and less developed per capita, was never fully occupied and ruled by outsiders and since the Korean War has not been ruled at all by white men. No US military, no English as official language, no US taxes, and national pride. Whatever foreign China brings in is for the appropriation and enjoyment of locals rather than a manifestation of the locals being controlled or ruled by foreign powers.</p><p>Finally, it's interesting to note how that physicist also said that China doesn't need to be as advanced as the United States to triumph over it. It can produce by itself just about everything now, and even if the quality is, crudely speaking, only 50% of what the most advanced countries have, China's sheer size and quantity alone is sufficient. He gave the analogy of how the Romans stilled ended up conquering and subjugating the Greeks despite their not really having any mathematics.</p>","id":"4127826921","createdAt":"2018-10-03T22:34:12","author":{"username":"gmachine1729","about":"","name":"gmachine1729","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2017-12-06T04:04:24","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/gmachine1729/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"273263163","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[{"thread":"6926282944","resolvedUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGwWE37TYns","thumbnailUrl":"//a.disquscdn.com/get?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FmGwWE37TYns%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=Rh3WWvstkg8RfJZFyNsjmg","htmlWidth":854,"id":46390679,"thumbnailWidth":480,"title":"\u654c\u8425\u5341\u516b\u5e74 02\uff08\u4e3b\u6f14\uff1a\u675c\u6df3\u3001\u738b\u9e4f\u51ef\u3001\u963f\u65af\u8339\u3001\u6234\u5a07\u5029\u3001\u9093\u5bb6\u4f73\uff09","htmlHeight":480,"mediaType":"3","html":"<iframe width=\"854\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLpfiCuV3cZ3fSHis2NGbDwyj6b8KWnZz2%26start%3D2603&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmGwWE37TYns&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FmGwWE37TYns%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=21d07d84db7f4d66a55297735025d6d1&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" height=\"480\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>","location":"mGwWE37TYns","type":"2","metadata":{"create_method":"preview","thumbnail":"//a.disquscdn.com/get?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FmGwWE37TYns%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=Rh3WWvstkg8RfJZFyNsjmg"},"urlRedirect":"https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmGwWE37TYns%26list%3DPLpfiCuV3cZ3fSHis2NGbDwyj6b8KWnZz2%26t%3D43m23s%3AnVD3s8h3jaWVSpa9P09jZ7P2UCA&cuid=320226","description":"1927\u5e74\uff0c\u5e7f\u5dde\u53d1\u751f\"\u56db\u00b7\u4e00\u4e94\"\u53cd\u9769\u547d\u653f\u53d8\uff0c\u5927\u6279\u4e2d\u5171\u515a\u5458\u88ab\u5c60\u6740\u3002\u9ec4\u57d4\u519b\u6821\u516d\u671f\u751f\u3001\u79d8\u5bc6\u4e2d\u5171\u515a\u5458\u6c5f\u6ce2\u8eab\u9677\u56f9\u5704\u3002\u8d63\u5357\u67d0\u5730\uff0c\u519c\u4f1a\u4f1a\u5458\u3001\u6c5f\u6ce2\u7684\u65b0\u5a5a\u59bb\u5b50\u5eb7\u745b\u88ab\u767d\u532a\u519b\u8ffd\u6740\uff0c\u6000\u7740\u8eab\u5b55\u9003\u4ea1\u5e7f\u5dde\u6295\u5954\u6c5f\u6ce2\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u6c5f\u6ce2\u5165\u72f1\u800c\u4e0d\u5f97\u76f8\u89c1\uff0c\u9971\u53d7\u78e8\u96be\u4e2d\u4ea7\u4e0b\u5973\u513f\u6885\u679c\u3002\u515a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fc5\u901f\u5c55\u5f00\u5bf9\u6c5f\u6ce2\u7684\u8425\u6551\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e74\u8f7b\u5973\u515a\u5458\u85e4\u7389\u83b2\u4ee5\u604b\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u901a\u8fc7\u519b\u9600\u65c5\u957f\u5ba3\u5b50\u5947\u6210\u529f\u4fdd\u91ca\u4e86\u6c5f\u6ce2\uff0c\u5e76\u9075\u5faa\u515a\u7684\u6307\u793a\u5c06\u6c5f\u6ce2\u5b89\u63d2\u8fdb\u4e86\u5ba3\u5b50\u5947\u519b\u4e2d\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6f2b\u957f\u7684\u654c\u8425\u751f\u6daf\uff0c\u6c5f\u6ce2\u7531\u4e00\u540d...","post":"4127826921","thumbnailURL":"//a.disquscdn.com/get?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FmGwWE37TYns%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=Rh3WWvstkg8RfJZFyNsjmg","providerName":"YouTube","forum":"infoproc","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGwWE37TYns&list=PLpfiCuV3cZ3fSHis2NGbDwyj6b8KWnZz2&t=43m23s","resolvedUrlRedirect":"http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmGwWE37TYns%3ABVK4GEVvUSV10VGGDfI0HloGHZw&cuid=320226","thumbnailHeight":360}],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isHighlighted":false,"parent":null,"isApproved":true,"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"So I saw a status from that physicist in https://gmachine1729.com/2018/09/25/a-chinese-theoretical-physicist-on-freedom-of-speech-lack-thereof-in-civilized-society/ on how that female physics Nobel laureate this year made her career with one breakthrough result/paper achieved as a PhD student, and how that alone trumped all those mediocre results/paper produced in China combined.

Many of the great mathematicians in US from the older generation where guys from Europe who moved there around the time of WWII. So mathematically, there is perhaps more truth than resentment? Even for latter half of 20th century in math, it's fair to say that France, USSR, and to a lesser extent Japan did more profound work in math than the Anglos. Anglo dominance has been more geopolitical and cultural, with English the de facto world language.\n\nAgain, China's rise and preeminence is mostly economic and geopolitical, in science it still has a long way to go. Even despite such a late start, Chinese produced SS Chern, CN Yang, TD Lee, Hua Luogeng, Wu Wenjun, etc, not bad. In 50 years, China could well become a scientific powerhouse too, in quality not just quantity.\n\nAs for the Nobel Peace Prize, I don't think people outside the West take it seriously at all. Heck, even within the West people are increasingly ridiculing it. It's too much of a joke.","parent_post":"forums.Post?id=4113596245","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6926282944","forum":"infoproc","url":"http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-french-way-alain-connes-interview.html#comment-4114094907","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"auth.User?id=1158751":{"username":"cdrsalamander","about":"I'm cute.

For example, PRC already had thermonuclear warheads by 1970, and if PRC had really wanted to, if the political situation during the cultural revolution had been more favorable, PRC could have sent men into space in the 70s, as PRC could already then send a satellite into orbit and bring it back to earth. Note that this was in the 70s when PRC was dirt poor. Overall, I would say though that PRC, technologically, is still quite a ways behind America at the leading edge. This is well represented by the fact that PRC still has to use a foreign made engine for its passenger aircraft C919 that is still like five years away from entering service. And that the ban on ZTE has crippled its business, because China still has a very fledgling CPU/semiconductor industry. However, give it another decade, and I would expect these gaps to be filled; I've only worked in software engineering, and nothing especially serious there, so I'm not exactly too qualified to judge, but I would expect that this type of thing requires very extensive testing. On the passenger aircraft, it was interesting to learn that PRC had started developing one, called the Y-10, in 1970 and test flied it in 1980, but the project was, unfortunately for China, cancelled in the early 80s largely because it had been spearheaded by Wang Hongwen of the Gang of Four, who was denounced following the cultural revolution, which many in China find regretful, because had the project continued, China may well have become a competitor of Boeing and Airbus by the 90s or 00s, or in other words, this resulted in a 20+ year delay. So some people in China will say that in 1980, the country was still dirt poor, but for many very advanced things, the expertise was basically already there.</p>","id":"3894988958","createdAt":"2018-05-10T21:18:21","author":{"username":"gmachine1729","about":"","name":"gmachine1729","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"joinedAt":"2017-12-06T04:04:24","profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/gmachine1729/","url":"","location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"isAnonymous":false,"id":"273263163","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/gmachine1729.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1554502111/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"isHighlighted":false,"parent":3887706554,"isApproved":true,"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"Mainland Chinese only began coming to the US for graduate school in the 80s.

For example, PRC already had thermonuclear warheads by 1970, and if PRC had really wanted to, if the political situation during the cultural revolution had been more favorable, PRC could have sent men into space in the 70s, as PRC could already then send a satellite into orbit and bring it back to earth. Note that this was in the 70s when PRC was dirt poor. Overall, I would say though that PRC, technologically, is still quite a ways behind America at the leading edge. This is well represented by the fact that PRC still has to use a foreign made engine for its passenger aircraft C919 that is still like five years away from entering service. And that the ban on ZTE has crippled its business, because China still has a very fledgling CPU/semiconductor industry. However, give it another decade, and I would expect these gaps to be filled; I've only worked in software engineering, and nothing especially serious there, so I'm not exactly too qualified to judge, but I would expect that this type of thing requires very extensive testing. On the passenger aircraft, it was interesting to learn that PRC had started developing one, called the Y-10, in 1970 and test flied it in 1980, but the project was, unfortunately for China, cancelled in the early 80s largely because it had been spearheaded by Wang Hongwen of the Gang of Four, who was denounced following the cultural revolution, which many in China find regretful, because had the project continued, China may well have become a competitor of Boeing and Airbus by the 90s or 00s, or in other words, this resulted in a 20+ year delay. So some people in China will say that in 1980, the country was still dirt poor, but for many very advanced things, the expertise was basically already there.","parent_post":"forums.Post?id=3887706554","canVote":false,"thread":"forums.Thread?id=6651108449","forum":"infoproc","points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},"forums.Thread?id=6851300954":{"feed":"https://pj-instapundit.disqus.com/analysis_dont_expect_beijings_south_china_sea_breakthrough_to_weaken_us_ties_with_asean/latest.rss","author":"auth.User?id=182842843","topics":[],"dislikes":0,"likes":0,"message":"","isSpam":false,"isDeleted":false,"category":"4812097","clean_title":"ANALYSIS: Don\u2019t expect Beijing\u2019s South China Sea \u2018breakthrough\u2019 to weaken US ties with Asean\u2026","userScore":0,"id":"6851300954","signedLink":"https://disq.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpjmedia.com%2Finstapundit%2F304691%2F&key=DAfjNtorSNcm1Q1z8fH-sQ","createdAt":"2018-08-13T14:46:56","hasStreaming":false,"raw_message":"","isClosed":false,"link":"https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/304691/","slug":"analysis_dont_expect_beijings_south_china_sea_breakthrough_to_weaken_us_ties_with_asean","forum":"forums.Forum?id=4235850","identifiers":["1-304691"],"posts":12,"userSubscription":false,"validateAllPosts":false,"title":"ANALYSIS: Don\u2019t expect Beijing\u2019s South China Sea \u2018breakthrough\u2019 to weaken US ties with Asean\u2026","highlightedPost":null},"forums.Thread?id=7079977916":{"feed":"https://gmachine1729.disqus.com/a_girl_from_china_studying_abroad_in_america_being_mistreated_by_a_jewish_landlord_consulting_me/latest.rss","author":"auth.User?id=273263163","topics":[],"dislikes":0,"likes":0,"message":"","isSpam":false,"isDeleted":false,"category":"7727299","clean_title":"A girl from China studying abroad in America being mistreated by a Jewish landlord, consulting me","userScore":0,"id":"7079977916","signedLink":"https://disq.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgmachine1729.com%2F2018%2F11%2F30%2Fa-girl-from-china-studying-abroad-in-america-being-mistreated-by-a-jewish-landlord-consulting-me%2F&key=_Wagv8-CC_gEkk6AMe1vFQ","createdAt":"2018-11-30T16:23:21","hasStreaming":false,"raw_message":"","isClosed":false,"link":"https://gmachine1729.com/2018/11/30/a-girl-from-china-studying-abroad-in-america-being-mistreated-by-a-jewish-landlord-consulting-me/","slug":"a_girl_from_china_studying_abroad_in_america_being_mistreated_by_a_jewish_landlord_consulting_me","forum":"forums.Forum?id=5564650","identifiers":["5154 https://gmachine1729.com/?p=5154"],"posts":2,"userSubscription":false,"validateAllPosts":false,"title":"A girl from China studying abroad in America being mistreated by a Jewish landlord, consulting me","highlightedPost":null},"forums.Post?id=3664485471":{"editableUntil":"2017-12-22T23:33:25","dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":1,"message":"<p>Mind explaining why you think that?
